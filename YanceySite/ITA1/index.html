      <p>The elder 18-year-old brother of Shiro. He is a virgin and has never had a girlfriend, and fears he will never get one for the rest of his life; consequently, he can be a pervert. However, at the same time, though he has perverted tendencies, he is very protective of his sister Shiro and is determined to raise her right, refusing to expose her to anything R-rated. He holds an absolute trust in her abilities and never doubts her decisions. When he was younger, Sora used to believe that humans were stupid and weak, but his faith in humanity had been restored after his first encounter with the brilliant 3-year-old Shiro. He wears a yellow shirt that says, "I Love Humanity."</p>

She has an innocent and composed appearance, but - like her stepbrother - has a perverted side as well.
